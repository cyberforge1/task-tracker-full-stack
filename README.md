## Goals & MVP
- The project aims to develop a Spring-based backend for managing todos in a MySQL database, paired with a React frontend for seamless user interaction. 

- The MVP features a polished UI for adding, completing, deleting, and editing todos with comprehensive error handling and toast notifications, while the backend ensures robust error management, request logging with Log4j, and API documentation via Spring Swagger.

# Frontend - React Typescript

## Tech Stack

- JSX
- SCSS
- Typescript
- React 
- Git 


## Build Steps
1. Clone the project from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:cyberforge1/task-tracker-full-stack.git

2. Create, initialize and link a MySQL database to the backend API

3. Run the backend API locally

4. Navigate to the frontend directory
   ```bash
   cd task-tracker-full-stack/frontend

5. Run the frontend locally 
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## How To Use
- Users can create a task by filling out the form inputs and submitting the 'Add Task' button. Tasks can then be completed, edited, or deleted with a button click. Features for sorting, searching and changing the user interface appearance are also available.


## Design Goals
- The objective for the frontend was to create a responsive, appealing and intuitive user interface that allows users to easily access the backend features. 


## Project Features
- [x] An efficient user interface to interact with the backend API to access CRUD functionality
- [x] Dynamic filtering for specific task status
- [x] Instantaneous searching for matching tasks 
- [x] Changing task data to complete or incomplete
- [x] Toggling capability between list and tile components for tasks



# Backend - Spring Boot API

## Tech Stack

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Swagger
- Log4j
- JUnit
- MySQL


## Build Steps
1. Install prerequisite software:
- Java Development Kit
- Apache Maven
- MySQL

2. Clone the project from GitHub:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:cyberforge1/task-tracker-full-stack.git
  ```

3. Navigate into the project directory
  ```bash
  cd task-tracker-full-stack
  ```

4. Open MySQL WorkBench (or access through CLI) and create a new database
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE new_database;
   ```

5. Navigate to src/main/resources and create a application.properties file in this directory:

6. Integrate your specific details into application.properties:
  ```sql
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/new_database_name
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```

7. Clean and build project:
  ```bash
  mvn clean install
  ```

8. Run the project locally:
  ```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```

9. Navigate to the following url to confirm project start:
  ```bash
   http://localhost:8080/todos
   ```

10. To access URL endpoints launch the application frontend or use software like Postman



## How To Use

To access this backend, first follow the build steps above. The application frontend provides a user interface to interact with this backend automatically, endpoints can also be accessed and tested through an applications like Postman, or Swagger UI.

## Design Goals
- The aim of this application was to create a robust API to create, read, update and delete task data. 


## Project Features
- [x] Comprehensive CRUD functionality with database access
- [x] A MySQL database to store task data  
- [x] User error notification for incorrect endpoint access
- [x] Enhanced logging features provided by Log4j
- [x] Project document generation by Spring Swagger
- [x] Unit testing provided by JUnit

# General

## Additions & Improvements
- [ ] Adding GitHub Workflow Badges
- [ ] User authentication and login functionality
- [ ] Integration of React Testing Library for frontend
- [ ] Providing toast notifications for error handling
- [ ] Troubleshooting backend integration and end-to-end testing
- [ ] Creating a Docker container for deployment


## Learning Highlights
- Practiced React skills by adding display toggling, dynamic filtering and searching into the application
- Applied various testing methods and libraries to the frontend and backend
- Building in different libraries to increase application scope and functionality 
- Gained independent experience building a Spring Boot application
- Built familiarity with Spring Boot elements (controllers, services, repositories, DTOs, etc.)
- Creating and integrating a MySQL database for desired data

## Challenges
- Building new features into the application with associated libraries to increase scope
- Learning how to apply unit-testing, integration testing and end-to end testing on the frontend and backend
